    <p>It is hard to go a whole day without using some sort of electronic device. Most people use a computer, or a handheld device like a smartphone or tablet, daily. These devices have an operating system (OS) that enable a user to use it.</p>
    <p>If you are reading this, then you have learned the English language. Computer language is binary, comprised of ones and zeros, like, 001010111010110101. Unless you can read really long strings of zeros and ones, you need an OS to translate what you want into a language the processors understand.</p>
    <p>Operating systems today also give the user a nice interface to interact with the computer. It is very convenient to open up a window on your screen and see the locations of all the folders and files on your machine, instead of the old days of typing text commands to navigate through the directories to find what you were looking for.</p>
    <p>There are many tasks that are handled by the operating system. It allocates the hardware resources for different applications. This includes the memory, CPU, and devices such as a keyboard and mouse.</p>
    <p>Since it handles all of the requests, it also decides who has access to what and when, and is the primary factor for system performance and effeciency.</p>
    <p>There are three main computer OS used today, and two for mobile devices.</p>
